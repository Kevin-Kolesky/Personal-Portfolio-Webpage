            <h1><u>Learning Journey - So Far!</u></h1>
            <div id="intro-p">
                Welcome to my personal portfolio! Over the past year, I've been on an exciting journey of learning and
                growth in web development.
                From small-scale projects like an RSVP forum to more complex applications, each project has helped me
                refine my skills and deepen my understanding of front-end and back-end development.
                Some are polished and complete, while others... well, let's just say they're still works in progress.
                <br>
                But hey, isn't that the fun of learning?<strong> Take a look around and see what I've been up
                    to!</strong>
                <br>
                <h3>Project Types</h3>
                A big part of my learning journey came from <span class="tag freeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp projects</span>.
                <br>
                These structured challenges helped me grasp fundamental web development concepts, from building
                responsive web pages with HTML and CSS to creating dynamic applications using JavaScript.
                Each project pushed me to apply what I learned in a practical way, reinforcing best practices and
                problem-solving skills. They were a great stepping stone in my growth as a developer.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, I also worked on projects given to me by Muano, my <span
                    class="tag tutor">tutor</span> which provided a different kind of challenge.
                Unlike the structured tutorials, these projects often required me to think more independently,
                troubleshoot real-world issues, and make design decisions on my own.
                They ranged from small interactive components to full-fledged applications, pushing me to refine my
                coding skills, improve my debugging abilities, and develop a deeper understanding of building scalable
                and efficient solutions.

                        <h2>Survey Form <span class="tag freeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp</span></h2>
                        This project was all about input elements—text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, you name it.
                        <br>
                        I built a form that (hopefully) doesn’t make people want to rage quit halfway through.
                        The main challenge was making sure everything was accessible and user-friendly.
                        <br>
                        In the end, I got a basioc understanding of form validation and styling, plus a newfound
                        appreciation for properly labeled inputs.

                        A simple project with a simple goal: make something look decent using CSS.
                        <br>
                        I put together a tribute page, played around with margins, padding, and text alignment, and
                        tried not to overthink it.
                        <br>
                        Turns out, even basic CSS can make a huge difference in making a page look polished.
                        <br>
                        Lesson learned: keep it clean, keep it readable, and don’t fight the box model.

                        <h2>Technical Documentation Page <span class="tag freeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp</span></h2>
                        One of my first projects was a Technical Documentation Page, where I dived into the world of
                        navigation bars.
                        <br>
                        The goal? Make it look good and actually work.
                        I played around with CSS, figuring out how to keep the nav fixed,
                        <br>
                        styled, and responsive without it breaking everything else.
                        <br>
                        The main takeaway? Navigation bars are trickier than they seem! But after some trial and error
                        (and a few moments of frustration),
                        <br>
                        I got a solid grasp on styling them properly —skills that have definitely come in handy since.

                <div class="frame-Container" id="product">

                        <h2>Product Landing Page <span class="tag freeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp</span></h2>
                        This one stepped things up a notch. I had to mix advanced CSS techniques with new HTML elements
                        to build a very custom landing page.
                        <br>
                        Flexbox and grids became my best friends, and I finally understood why position: absolute can be
                        both a lifesaver and a nightmare.
                        <br>
                        The biggest takeaway?
                        Layouts don’t have to be stressful if you plan ahead and navbars can work in mobile as too.

                        Time to jump into JavaScript! This project was all about working with arrays and array
                        functions.
                        <br>
                        I built a script to check if a word or phrase is the same forward and backward—sounds easy until
                        you start handling spaces, punctuation, and casing.
                        <br>
                        After some debugging, I walked away with a better understanding of split(), reverse(), and
                        join(), and a deep respect for well-written regex.

                        Recursion: the thing that makes your brain hurt but also makes your code way cooler.
                        <br>
                        This project had me breaking down numbers and converting them into Roman numerals using
                        recursive functions.
                        <br>
                        At first, it felt like my logic was looping in circles (because it was), but once I got the hang
                        of it, recursion became a powerful tool in my JS arsenal.

                        This one was all about making images look good without breaking the layout.
                        <br>
                        I got hands-on with Flexbox and Grid, figuring out how to arrange images neatly and
                        responsively.
                        <br>
                        I also dabbled in JavaScript for the first time here to add modals for viewing images up close.
                        <br>
                        The big win? Finally understanding when to use display: flex vs. display: grid without just
                        guessing.

                        Simple in theory, tricky in execution.
                        <br>
                        I built a basic calculator to practice JavaScript operators, handling user input, and updating
                        the display dynamically.
                        <br>
                        Turns out, making sure your calculator doesn’t break when someone mashes buttons randomly is
                        harder than it sounds.
                        <br>
                        But hey, now I know how to handle edge cases (like dividing by zero)!

                        Here’s where things got interactive. The goal was to let users add and remove names dynamically,
                        which meant diving into JavaScript DOM manipulation.
                        <br>
                        After some trial and error (and accidental infinite loops), I got the form working smoothly.
                        <br>
                        Biggest lesson? appendChild() is your friend, and keeping track of event listeners is a must.

                        This was my first big project, and it taught me a ton. I dived into Node.js, used Nodemon to
                        speed
                        up development, and applied CRUD operations to manage users.
                        <br>
                        I built login and register forms, added custom validations with Bootstrap, and even stored user
                        data
                        in MySQL.
                        <br>
                        I also learned about environment variables (ENV files), worked with bcrypt for password hashing,
                        and
                        tested everything in Postman.
                        <br>
                        On top of that, I got familiar with GitHub Pages and started properly separating the frontend
                        and
                        backend.
                        <br>
                        It was a huge learning experience, and by the end, I bagan to understand what it takes to make
                        full-stack applications.

                        This one is still a work in progress, but it’s already taught me a lot. I started from scratch with
                        Model-View-Controller (MVC) concepts and built authentication using <strong>JWTs</strong>,
                        <strong>sessions</strong>, and <strong>cookies</strong>.
                        <br>
                        One of the biggest <strong>challenges</strong> has been getting authentication to work
                        properly—handling user sessions, securing tokens, and making sure everything functions smoothly
                        without weird login issues.
                        <br>
                        I also worked with <strong>middleware</strong> for request handling and styled everything with
                        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>.
                        <br>
                        There’s still more to do, but this project has been a deep dive into backend architecture and
                        authentication—definitely one of my most challenging projects yet!
